1- Justification of Selected Features

Credit_score is a key feature because a borrower’s historical credit behavior strongly influences the likelihood of repayment or default.

Debt_to_income is crucial because it measures the borrower’s existing financial burden, and higher ratios indicate limited capacity to take on additional loan payments.

Annual_income helps predict default because higher, stable income increases the borrower’s ability to repay the loan consistently.

Loan_amount is relevant because larger loans increase monthly payment obligations, making default more likely if the borrower’s income cannot support it.

Interest_rate affects repayment risk because higher interest leads to higher total cost of borrowing, increasing the chance of financial stress and default.

Employment_length is informative because longer job stability typically correlates with more predictable income and lower default risk.

Num_delinquencies directly signals past repayment issues, making it one of the most predictive indicators of future default.

Total_utilization matters because borrowers who are using a high percentage of their available credit are more likely to face liquidity problems and miss payments.

Num_open_accounts helps capture overall credit activity; too few accounts may indicate thin credit history, while too many may signal financial overextension.

Home_ownership is useful because owning a home often indicates stronger financial stability and lower default probability compared to renting.

Purpose is relevant because the reason for the loan (e.g., medical bills vs. home improvement) often correlates with different levels of financial risk.

Term is important because longer-term loans spread repayment over time but may increase the chance of long-term financial instability, affecting default likelihood.

Application_type helps because joint applications may offer more repayment capacity, whereas single applications rely on one income source.

2- Features Excluded and Why

Age is excluded because in many jurisdictions it is considered a protected attribute and cannot be used for credit decisions.

State is excluded because it adds geographic granularity without necessarily improving prediction, and may introduce regional bias.

Zip_code is excluded because it can indirectly encode socioeconomic status or ethnicity, raising fairness and regulatory concerns.

3- Encoding and Missing Value Strategy

Categorical features such as home_ownership, purpose, state, and application_type would be encoded so the model can interpret them numerically.
Missing values in numerical features would be imputed using the median, while categorical features would be imputed with the most frequent category to avoid introducing artificial.
