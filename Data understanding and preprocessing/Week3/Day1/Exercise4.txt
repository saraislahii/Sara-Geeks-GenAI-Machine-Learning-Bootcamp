Iris Dataset — Data Type Classification

The Iris dataset typically contains the following columns:

Id

SepalLengthCm

SepalWidthCm

PetalLengthCm

PetalWidthCm

Species

Below is a full classification of each column as qualitative or quantitative, with explanations.
---------------------------------------
 Quantitative Columns (Numerical data)
1. Id

Type: Quantitative (discrete)

Why: It consists of integer identifiers. Although it doesn’t represent a real measurement, it is numeric.

2. SepalLengthCm

Type: Quantitative (continuous)

Why: Represents the measured length of the sepal in centimeters. You can calculate averages, differences, etc.

3. SepalWidthCm

Type: Quantitative (continuous)

Why: A real numerical measurement of sepal width.

4. PetalLengthCm

Type: Quantitative (continuous)

Why: A measurable physical quantity (petal length).

5. PetalWidthCm

Type: Quantitative (continuous)

Why: Also a numerical measurement representing the width of the petal.
-----------------------------------
Qualitative Columns (Categorical data)
6. Species

Type: Qualitative (categorical)

Why: This column contains labels describing the flower species (e.g., Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica).
These are groups not numbers and we do not perform arithmetic on them.
