Column Types
1. index

Type: Quantitative (discrete)
Reasoning:
This is simply a numeric row identifier. It takes integer values, even though it doesn’t represent a real-world measurement.

2. Year

Type: Quantitative (discrete)
Reasoning:
Years are numeric and ordered. Even though they label time periods, they behave like numerical values (e.g., you can calculate differences between years).

3. Period

Type: Qualitative (categorical)
Reasoning:
The value is a label such as "Annual." There’s no inherent numeric meaning or ordering.

4. Avg hrs per day sleeping

Type: Quantitative (continuous)
Reasoning:
This is a numerical measurement representing average hours spent sleeping. It can take decimal values and supports arithmetic.

5. Standard Error

Type: Quantitative (continuous)
Reasoning:
A numerical statistical estimate. Continuous and mathematical operations are meaningful.

6. Type of Days

Type: Qualitative (categorical)
Reasoning:
Values like “All days” describe groups of days. These are labels with no numeric interpretation.

7. Age Group

Type: Qualitative (categorical)
Reasoning:
Categories such as “15 years and over.” Even though numbers appear in the text, the column represents groups, not actual numeric ages.

8. Activity

Type: Qualitative (categorical)
Reasoning:
Describes the type of activity—here always “Sleeping.” Purely a descriptive label.

9. Sex

Type: Qualitative (categorical)
Reasoning:
Values like “Both,” “Male,” or “Female” identify groups, not numeric measures.
