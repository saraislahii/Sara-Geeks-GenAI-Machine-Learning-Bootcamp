👩‍🏫 👩🏿‍🏫 What You’ll learn
In these exercises, you will learn how to use Seaborn, a powerful data visualization library in Python,
for exploring and understanding data through visualization. Specifically, you will:

Learn how to visualize the distribution of data using histograms.
Understand how to compare data across different categories using bar plots.
Explore relationships between numerical data points with scatter plots.
Discover patterns in your data using pair plots and heatmaps.
Analyze data distributions and relationships across subgroups with FacetGrid.


🛠️ What you will create
By completing these exercises, you will create a series of visualizations that will help you uncover 
insights from the student mental health dataset. These include:

Histograms to understand the distribution of students’ CGPA.
Bar plots to compare anxiety levels across different genders.
Scatter plots to investigate the relationship between age and the occurrence of panic attacks.
Pair plots to visualize pairwise relationships and distributions across multiple variables, highlighting
mental health conditions.
Heatmaps to visualize the correlation matrix of students’ age, CGPA, and mental health status indicators.
FacetGrids to analyze the distribution of CGPA across different levels of depression status.
